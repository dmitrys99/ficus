# Far manager colorer syntax highlight for Ficus

There is a syntax highlight definition for [Colorer](https://github.com/colorer/FarColorer/) library.

Checked with [Far2l](https://github.com/elfmz/far2l), should work with Far manager as well.

If you know what Colorer is, you'll be able to install it. Good luck!
